# Word Counter Tech Test

### Overview
This is a word counter tech test written in JavaScript. The task is to write a JavaScript application that takes any given text file and outputs the following:

1. Individual words that appear and the number of times the word occurs in that file.
2. Whether the number of times each word occurs is a prime number.

#### Assumptions:
1. Punctuation and capitalisation can be ignored.
2. TDD is expected.


### My approach
1. **User Stories**: Broke down problem into user stories.
2. **Mock-up**: Mock-up page of how I imagine the final product will look, (see image below).
